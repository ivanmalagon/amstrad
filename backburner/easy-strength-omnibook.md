Training must not be so extreme that it leads to a loss of motivation, overtraining or injury, the three biggest threats to any athlete’s performance.

Generally, the most important things in life are simple. Maintaining a clean house, loving your children, walking, appropriate eating, and sleeping soundly are all simple. Easy? Just talk to someone who has issues with the simple things in life.

True learning tends to happen when people aren’t fearing for their lives.

## The Basic “Top 10” List of Easy Strength

1. Keep the exercises to a minimum. Most compound, multi-joint exercises work well. Generally, the overhead press, the deadlift, the pullup, and the ab wheel work the best.

2. Lift two to five times a week.

3. The repetitions should be in the one-to-five range. There’s magic in doing doubles and triples.

4. The TOTAL volume daily is around 10 reps per exercise. But if you’re
just doing singles, you probably only have six good reps in the tank. These
options work best:
⁃ Five sets of two
⁃ Two sets of five
⁃ Three sets of three
⁃ A set of five, add weight. A set of three, add weight, a double (5–3–2)
⁃ Six progressively heavy singles
⁃ One easy set of 10 (tonic day)

Generally—most of the time—stay with the same load for all
sets. However, with the 5–3–2 and the six singles, add load.

5. Rest as appropriate between sets. If you have time, rest up to five minutes (which is a LOT of rest), but add some easy relaxation drills or self- massage, or, as we do at our gym, Tim Anderson’s Original Strength.

6. Always finish a set KNOWING you could have done two or more additional reps with the load.

7. If on that occasional wonderful day you’re feeling oddly strong, go heavy. Feel free to lift a personal record for singles or repetitions. However, hold back from doing what I call a “Max Max Max”

8. Vary the workouts both in intensity and load.

9. Using Easy Strength in-season simply requires reducing the volume.

10. THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT: Finish your workouts feeling stronger (better!) than when you began. Always walk out the door with the idea that you could have used more load for more reps.
