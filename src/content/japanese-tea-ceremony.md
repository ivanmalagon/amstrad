# The Art of Japanese Tea Ceremony

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu, is a cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha, powdered green tea. It's a spiritual practice that embodies harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility.

The ceremony is not just about drinking tea, but about creating a moment of peace and mindfulness. Every movement, from the preparation to the serving, is carefully choreographed and meaningful.
