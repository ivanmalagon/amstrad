# The Golden Age of Science Fiction

Science fiction has evolved from pulp magazines to a respected literary genre that explores the impact of science and technology on society. The golden age of science fiction, roughly from the late 1930s to the 1950s, produced many classics that still influence the genre today.

Authors like Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert A. Heinlein laid the foundation for modern science fiction, exploring themes that remain relevant in today's rapidly changing world.
