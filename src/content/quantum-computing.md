# Understanding Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to processing information. Unlike classical computers that use bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

> "Quantum computing is not just about faster computation, it's about different computation."

This technology has the potential to solve complex problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. From cryptography to drug discovery, the applications of quantum computing are vast and exciting.
